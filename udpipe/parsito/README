Parsito
=======

Parsito is a fast open-source dependency parser written in C++. Parsito is based
on greedy transition-based parsing, it has very high accuracy and achieves a
throughput of 30K words per second. Parsito can be trained on any input data
without feature engineering, because it utilizes artificial neural network
classifier. Trained models for all treebanks from Universal Dependencies project
are available (37 treebanks as of Dec 2015).
