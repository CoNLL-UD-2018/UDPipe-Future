WARNING:tensorflow:From /lnet/spec/work/people/straka/repos/conll2018_udpipe/venv-cpu/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/losses/losses_impl.py:691: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.
