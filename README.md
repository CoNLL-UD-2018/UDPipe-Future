# UDPipe-Future

UDPipe-Future is a prototype for UDPipe 2.0. The prototype consists of tagging
and parsing and is purely in Python. It participated in CoNLL 2018 UD Shared
Task and was one of three winners.

The `master` branch of this repository contains post-Shared-Task improvements.
The original system submitted to the Shared Task can be found in `shared-task`
branch.

UDPipe 2.0 is currently being developed in the
[udpipe-2 branch](https://github.com/ufal/udpipe/tree/udpipe-2)
of the
[udpipe repository](https://github.com/ufal/udpipe)
and a first
[release](https://github.com/ufal/udpipe/releases)
is expected in 2021.
