# UDPipe-Future

UDPipe-Future is a prototype for UDPipe 2.0. The prototype consists of tagging
and parsing and is purely in Python. It participated in CoNLL 2018 UD Shared
Task and was one of three winners.

The UDPipe 2.0, based on this prototype, will be again C++ application (with the
same interface as now), and we target to release it with UD 2.3, i.e., 15 Nov
2018.
